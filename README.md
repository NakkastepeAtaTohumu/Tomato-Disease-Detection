# Tomato-Disease-Detection
This repository is an attempt to detect diseases in tomato plants using their leaves. It is built using a powerful Keras model that was trained using the Teachable Machine. The model is capable of analyzing the leaves of the plants, extracting relevant features and using those to accurately identify potential diseases. This is done by leveraging the deep learning capabilities of the Keras model to learn the patterns that are associated with the diseases. In addition, this repository also implements a number of techniques to further increase the accuracy of the model by reducing the chances of false positives and negatives. This project is an invaluable resource for those looking to detect diseases in tomato plants in an efficient and reliable manner. Note that this model is not 100% accurate and may produce false results. It is still a work in progress.
